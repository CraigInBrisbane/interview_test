# Interview Test
A project based on test requirements for an interview test.

## Requirements
Create a super simple weather app. Please build the frontend in Angular and the backend API in C#

## Design
As this is an intervew test, the project is over engineered. I chose to impliment an API to gather the data, and return it to the UI, allowing the UI to be dumd. For added points, I made use of dependency injection, to enable very basic unit testing. The only logic I could gather was the temperature conversion logic.


## Installation
1. Clone the repo from https://github.com/CraigInBrisbane/interview_test.git

2. From the root folder, install NPM packages by running NPM Installation
